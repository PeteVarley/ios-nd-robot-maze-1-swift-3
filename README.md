# Robot Maze 1

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains code for Robot Maze 1 project in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

Robot Maze is an iOS application where users direct a robot around a maze and to its final destination. There are two versions of Robot Maze, each with their own unique robot:

- Maze-SimpleRobot
  - Responds to commands to move in cardinal directions
- Maze-ComplexRobot
  - Responds to commonds to move and rotate

## Setup

The main logic for the robot is in `ControlCenter.swift`. This is where you should direct your edits and implement functionality for the robot(s). Otherwise, there are no special setup instructions, just build and run!
